# Drone build Surge Protector
Plugin for Drone that kills old builds when new ones are started.

### Why
Do you have some expensive builds? (For example, large/slow test suites)

Do you have some jerk that pushes a bunch of commits to their PR branch while working
without caring about the results until they are done? (For example, Brian)

Do you have an overworked drone cluster that occasionally can't keep up with the barrage described above?

Try this maybe?

### How
```

```

This plugin was only tested against Drone 0.8.x
